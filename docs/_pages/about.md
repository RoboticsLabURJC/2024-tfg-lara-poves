Hello, my name is BÃ¡rbara and I am currently finishing my degree in Robotics Engineering at URJC.

I am passionate about programming and everything related to robots and helping people through robotics.
Currently improving my knowledge about ROS, ROS2, C++, Python, C,...etc.

I am a hard-working, constant person who hardly gives up on things. I love challenges and overcome them and always trying to move forward to be competent in the future
