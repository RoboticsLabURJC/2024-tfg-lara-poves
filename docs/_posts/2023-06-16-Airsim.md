## Why use Airsim?
First, Airsim is a simulator open source that it use in robotic applications and machine learning. AirSim provides a realistic simulated environment for experimenting with control, navigation and perception algorithms on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ground vehicles and water vehicles. The simulator is compatible with platforms such as Linux, Windows and macOS.

In your case, we use Linux. 

Airsim has different environments depending on the application. 

### Scenarios within Airsim

Mentioned above, airsim offers different scenarios, such as: 

1. AbandonedPark
2. Africa
3. AirSimNH: It's a small urban neighborhood
4. Blocks 
5. Building_99 
6. LandscapeMountains
7. MSBuild2018 (soccer field)
8. TrapCamera
9. ZhangJiajie

Depend the version releases for Linux, we can have a other scenarios, as instance: 

- City: Large environment with moving vehicles and pedestrians.These scenarios consist of 2 packages
- Forest

### Sensors 

Airsim provides differentes sensors as instance: 

1. Camera
2. Barometer
3. Imu
4. Gps
5. Magnetometer
6. Distance Sensor
7. Lidar

### Environment

In Airsim, you can configure the enviroment:  

1. The weather: you can have effects as instance rain,fog,dug,snow,etc. 
2. Time of day,atmospheric effects
3. Collision and detection 

### Vehicles types 

In Airsim, it exists differents types of availables vehicles: 

1. PhysXCar: Represents a ground vehicle with realistic physics based on  the PhysX physics engine.

2. SimpleFlight : Represents a drone with a simplified flight model.

3. SimpleQuadcopter: Represents a quadcopter type drone with a basic flight model.

4. SimpleWheeledVehicle: Represents a wheeled ground vehicle with a simplified physics model.
